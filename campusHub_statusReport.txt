Campus Hub Project Log
----------------------------

Jan 19th, 2026
What's done till now?
- frontend -> react pages (login, student reg, employee reg) done, properly working.
- backend -> project created in STS for backend. some packages already added, class are not built yet.
- both frontend and backend project are added to the GitHub, updates are being reflected properly.
- no issue so far.
==================================================================

Jan 20th, 2026
- done with C from CRUD operations successfully!
- encountered several errors:
	- Postgres database permission denied - SOLUTION: granted permission to the database user
		psql -U postgres -d campushub
		Password for user postgres:
		campushub=# GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO campushub_user;
		GRANT
		campushub=# ALTER DATABASE campushub OWNER TO campushub_user;
		ALTER DATABASE
	
- Cors related error - http req has been blocked by cors policy -> SOLUTION: added a SecurityConfigCors Class
	- NullPointerExcepstion - in StudentService class @Autowired missing above StudentRepository object. So i added the annotations
- student is able to register, database showing the data.
- Hurray, i am able to go to dashboard after registering and login in.
- updated StudentRegister, Home.jsx files. Created a StudentDashboard.jsx file for verifying student's credentials from database and navigating to the dashboard.
- so many errors to handle especially in React:
	1. Backend Error - Caused by: org.springframework.data.mapping.PropertyReferenceException: No property 'userIdPassword' found for type 'Student'
	custom method name (shown in above line) was incorrect so i changed it to findByAdmissionNoAndPassword (this was ok).
	2. Frontend Error - first of all i updated the wrong file for task = Login -> Dashboard. In this i should be updating the Home.jsx file but I have been keeping on updating the Login.jsx file. 	And wondering why when i am entering the data inside the Login form (that is in Home.jsx) i am not able to go to dashboard and the data that i entered was shown in address bar. 
	This silly mistake has wasted a few hours.

- now everything is working fine and next task is:
	1. do same things with Employee (registering, login to EmployeeDashboard).
	2. add links in dashboard (Profile, change password, view attendance, etc.).
	3. perform remaining CRUD operations.
==================================================================

Jan 22, 2026
- Employee can register, login and go to their dashboard
- Error Occurred: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.campushub.repository.EmployeeRepository.findByEidAndPassword(String, String)" because "this.employeeRepository" is null
	because in LoginController.java i have applied @Autowired to multiple lines at once like:
		@Autowired
		Type varName;
		Type2 varName2;
	which is not allowed, so resolved by autowiring separately:-
		@Autowired
		Type varName;
		@Autowired
		Type2 varName2;

- there was the need of some changes in sending employee to dashboard. specific employee (like faculty, hod, etc.) are required to go to their respective dashboards. so i have to change a lot with backend and front.
- there was issue with login because of Role(student, parent, faculty, hod, etc.) and Type (of employee).
- now everything is ok. i have to make 2 more employee dashboards hod and exam controller now. then work on 'parent login'

- hod and exam controller dashboard navigation done.
==================================================================

Jan 23, 2026
- client side validations applied, so many errors occurred but resolved eventually, 

- 'photo' field removed for simplification.

- server side validation added using annotations like @NotBlank, @Email, @Size, @Pattern for both Student and Employee registration fields.
- checked working of client side validations using Postman.
- files modified -> StudentService, StudentController, 
- StudentRequest (added in dto package)
- similarly for Employee
- a GlobalExceptionHandler file created in exception package to handle exceptions globally.

PROMPT FOR ATTENDANCE:
i want to implement the attendance module now, in this a faculty uploads attendance of students in a class. for that faculty choses course, branch and then class (for example, for marking the attendance of section A of CSE 1st year (semester 1, semester 2) the class name should be CSE1A, for section B of DS 3rd year class name is DS3B, and similarly other classes (Branch Year Section).) After choosing the correct class, all students of that class should be listed and two action button 'P' for Present and 'A' for Absent should be there to mark the attendance. by default keep every student's attendance to 'A' help me with this, how should i begin. The frontend file name is UploadAttendance.jsx inside 'faculty' folder.
Tell me what files to make where to make in backend. how database tables are made, and everything.

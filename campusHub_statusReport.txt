Campus Hub Project Log
----------------------------

Jan 19th, 2026
What's done till now?
- frontend -> react pages (login, student reg, employee reg) done, properly working.
- backend -> project created in STS for backend. some packages already added, class are not built yet.
- both frontend and backend project are added to the GitHub, updates are being reflected properly.
- no issue so far.
==================================================================

Jan 20th, 2026
- done with C from CRUD operations successfully!
- encountered several errors:
	- Postgres database permission denied - SOLUTION: granted permission to the database user
		psql -U postgres -d campushub
		Password for user postgres:
		campushub=# GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO campushub_user;
		GRANT
		campushub=# ALTER DATABASE campushub OWNER TO campushub_user;
		ALTER DATABASE
	
- Cors related error - http req has been blocked by cors policy -> SOLUTION: added a SecurityConfigCors Class
	- NullPointerExcepstion - in StudentService class @Autowired missing above StudentRepository object. So i added the annotations
- student is able to register, database showing the data.
- Hurray, i am able to go to dashboard after registering and login in.
- updated StudentRegister, Home.jsx files. Created a StudentDashboard.jsx file for verifying student's credentials from database and navigating to the dashboard.
- so many errors to handle especially in React:
	1. Backend Error - Caused by: org.springframework.data.mapping.PropertyReferenceException: No property 'userIdPassword' found for type 'Student'
	custom method name (shown in above line) was incorrect so i changed it to findByAdmissionNoAndPassword (this was ok).
	2. Frontend Error - first of all i updated the wrong file for task = Login -> Dashboard. In this i should be updating the Home.jsx file but I have been keeping on updating the Login.jsx file. 	And wondering why when i am entering the data inside the Login form (that is in Home.jsx) i am not able to go to dashboard and the data that i entered was shown in address bar. 
	This silly mistake has wasted a few hours.

- now everything is working fine and next task is:
	1. do same things with Employee (registering, login to EmployeeDashboard).
	2. add links in dashboard (Profile, change password, view attendance, etc.).
	3. perform remaining CRUD operations.
==================================================================

- Employee can register, login and go to their dashboard
- Error Occurred: java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "com.campushub.repository.EmployeeRepository.findByEidAndPassword(String, String)" because "this.employeeRepository" is null
	because in LoginController.java i have applied @Autowired to multiple lines at once like:
		@Autowired
		Type varName;
		Type2 varName2;
	which is not allowed, so resolved by autowiring separately:-
		@Autowired
		Type varName;
		@Autowired
		Type2 varName2;

- there was the need of some changes in sending employee to dashboard. specific employee (like faculty, hod, etc.) are required to go to their respective dashboards. so i have to change a lot with backend and front.
- there was issue with login because of Role(student, parent, faculty, hod, etc.) and Type (of employee).
- now everything is ok. i have to make 2 more employee dashboards hod and exam controller now. then work on 'parent login'

- hod and exam controller dashboard navigation done.
==================================================================

Jan 23, 2026
- client side validations applied, so many errors occurred but resolved eventually, 

- 'photo' field removed for simplification.

- server side validation added using annotations like @NotBlank, @Email, @Size, @Pattern for both Student and Employee registration fields.
- checked working of client side validations using Postman.
- files modified -> StudentService, StudentController, 
- StudentRequest (added in dto package)
- similarly for Employee
- a GlobalExceptionHandler file created in exception package to handle exceptions globally.

NEXT WORK TO BE DONE
- some issue with Login occurred. will resolve tomorrow.
- password hashing and some database table constraints
==================================================================

Jan 24, 2026
- Login issue resolved just have to make changes in Home.jsx

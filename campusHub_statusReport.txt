- done with C from CRUD operations successfully!
- encountered several errors:
	- Postgres database permission denied - SOLUTION: granted permission to the database user
		psql -U postgres -d campushub
		Password for user postgres:
		campushub=# GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO campushub_user;
		GRANT
		campushub=# ALTER DATABASE campushub OWNER TO campushub_user;
		ALTER DATABASE
	
- Cors related error - http req has been blocked by cors policy -> SOLUTION: added a SecurityConfigCors Class
	- NullPointerExcepstion - in StudentService class @Autowired missing above StudentRepository object. So i added the annotations
- student is able to register, database showing the data.
- Hurray, i am able to go to dashboard after registering and login in.
- updated StudentRegister, Home.jsx files. Created a StudentDashboard.jsx file for verifying student's credentials from database and navigating to the dashboard.
- so many errors to handle especially in React:
	1. Backend Error - Caused by: org.springframework.data.mapping.PropertyReferenceException: No property 'userIdPassword' found for type 'Student'
	custom method name (shown in above line) was incorrect so i changed it to findByAdmissionNoAndPassword (this was ok).
	2. Frontend Error - first of all i updated the wrong file for task = Login -> Dashboard. In this i should be updating the Home.jsx file but I have been keeping on updating the Login.jsx file. 	And wondering why when i am entering the data inside the Login form (that is in Home.jsx) i am not able to go to dashboard and the data that i entered was shown in address bar. 
	This silly mistake has wasted a few hours.

- now everything is working fine and next task is:
	1. do same things with Employee (registering, login to EmployeeDashboard).
	2. add links in dashboard (Profile, change password, view attendance, etc.).
	3. perform remaining CRUD operations.
